Below is a dataset for daily vaccination numbers per country.  Please implement a small program that reads the input file and produces the desired outputs for below questions, optimized for speed of operation. (Preferred language is Python or C#) 

Please paste the link to the code implementation tasks as answer shared using pastebin, github, bitbucket, coderpad.io, dotnetfiddle, jsfiddle, or any other public web-site.

Code Implementation Task: Implement code to fill the missing data (impute) in daily_vaccinations column per country with the minimum daily vaccination number of relevant countries.  
Note: If a country does not have any valid vaccination number yet, fill it with “0” (zero).

Code Implementation Task: If this list would be a database table, please provide SQL query to fill in the missing daily vaccination numbers with discrete median of country as similar to question a.  
Please  provide the link to your code as answer to this question. 
Note: This time SQL equivalent is requested, and imputation value is median of each country, not minimum. Please remember filling countries with zero if they do not have any valid daily_vaccination records like Kuwait.
